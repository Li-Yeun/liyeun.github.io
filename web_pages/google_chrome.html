                <h3> History of Google Chrome</h3>
                <p>
                    The first version of Google Chrome was planned to release on September 3, 2008. The actual first public release was on September 2, 2008 for windows XP.
                    This first version was officially a beta version, the first public stable release was on December 11, 2008.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Google CEO Eric Schmidt actually opposed the idea of an independent web browser related to Google for six years. He stated "at the time, Google was a small company" and did not want to go through "bruising browser wars".
                    Co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin hired several Mozilla Firefox developers to build a prototype of Google Chrome. Schmidt stated "it was so good that it forced to change my mind".
                </p>

                <p>
                    Chrome was assembled from 25 different code libraries from Google and third parties such as Mozilla's Netscape Portable Runtime and SQLite.
                    At first Chrome used the WebKit rendering engine to display web pages, they later forked the WebCore component in 2013 to create their own layout engine named Blink.
                    <br>
                    Blink only uses WebKit's "WebCore" components. Other Components such as Blink its own multiprocess architecture were used in place of WebKit's native implementation.
